T1 is used for slow horizontal movement and platform drops. Can also be used for up tilts. Horizontal movement set to be the fastest that will still cancel a dash into a walk.


T2 is used for fast walking horizontal movement, up tilts, and crouch cancels. Horizontal movement set to be the fastest that will not force a dash. Down movement is as fast as possible for crouch cancels and fast falls.ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ6A6A'6A?,1,5NN€€ÿÚ476A6A'6A4848+€€ÿ-ø48
